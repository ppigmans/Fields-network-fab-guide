Due to the scientists and engineers combined effort they have tried to devlop as many advanced technologies as they could for the frame, thus giving it excellent radar range and hacking abilites but ending up severely lacking in armor and durability, rendering the frame somewhat unfit for combat It has also been proven that the frame's viability increases in space due to its advanced thrusters allowing it to outperform the enemy lancer's of [DATA EXPUNGED]</div>",
