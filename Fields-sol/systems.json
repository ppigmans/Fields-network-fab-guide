        "description": "This is a self-propelled, semi-autonomous unit with rudimentary intelligence. Unless otherwise specified, Drones are Size 1/2 characters that are allied to the user and have 10 Evasion, 5 HP, and 0 Armor. To be used they must be deployed to a free, valid space within Sensors and line of sight, typically as a quick action. Once deployed, they can be recalled with the same action used to deploy them (quick action or full action, etc.), rejoining with your mech. By default, Drones can’t take actions or move; if they do have actions or movement, they act on their user’s turn. They benefit from cover and other defenses as usual, and make all mech skill checks and saves at +0. If a Drone reaches 0 HP, it is destroyed and must be repaired before it can be used again – like any system. As long as a Drone  hasn’t been destroyed, it is restored to full HP when the user rests or performs a Full Repair. Deployed Drones  persist for the rest of the scene, until destroyed, or until otherwise specified."
