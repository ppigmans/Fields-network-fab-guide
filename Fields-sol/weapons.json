The charging sequence of the HLBC is a spectacle on its own, as energy seemingly comes out of nowhere (while in reality it is being released through tiny spikes on the capacitor units), quickly filling the firing chamber with a shining, golden light, adding to the sense of imagery of a divine weapon.  Once a weapon that was often used to protect the population of KM factory worlds, now has become twisted, used by Fields Network to perform deeds beyond reasoning.",
